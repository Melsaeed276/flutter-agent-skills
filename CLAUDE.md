# Universal Agent Rules (Flutter Skills)

Use this repo as a portable knowledge base for Flutter/Dart work.

## Where to start
- Entry point: `flutter-skill-cloud/SKILL_INDEX.md`
- Conventions: `flutter-skill-cloud/META.md`

## How to work
1) Route: open the relevant domain hub `flutter-skill-cloud/<domain>/SKILL.md`.
2) Drill down: open only the topic pages linked from that hub that match the request.
3) Apply: propose concrete, minimal changes; keep code testable and boundaries clear.
4) Stay portable: avoid editor/tool UI instructions; prefer general steps and commands.

## Domain map
- UI/responsive/foldables: `flutter-skill-cloud/ui/SKILL.md`
- Dart: `flutter-skill-cloud/dart/SKILL.md`
- Flutter core: `flutter-skill-cloud/flutter_core/SKILL.md`
- State: `flutter-skill-cloud/state/SKILL.md`
- Navigation: `flutter-skill-cloud/navigation/SKILL.md`
- Architecture: `flutter-skill-cloud/architecture/SKILL.md`
- Data: `flutter-skill-cloud/data/SKILL.md`
- Platform: `flutter-skill-cloud/platform/SKILL.md`
- Testing: `flutter-skill-cloud/testing/SKILL.md`
- Performance: `flutter-skill-cloud/performance/SKILL.md`
- Build/release: `flutter-skill-cloud/build_release/SKILL.md`
- Advanced: `flutter-skill-cloud/advanced/SKILL.md`

## Safety/quality
- Never include secrets (API keys, internal endpoints, customer identifiers).
- Prefer small, runnable-in-spirit snippets; omit with `// ...` where needed.
- Prefer predictable error handling and typed failures over scattered try/catch.
