# Code Review Checklist

## Checklist

- [ ] State is explicit (loading/success/empty/error) and tested.
- [ ] UI respects constraints; no hard-coded magic sizes without rationale.
- [ ] Navigation is declarative and parameters are typed/validated.
- [ ] Error handling surfaces actionable messages and preserves diagnostics.
- [ ] Performance: no unnecessary rebuilds; list rendering is efficient.
- [ ] Accessibility: semantics labels where needed; keyboard focus where relevant.
- [ ] Docs: new docs linked from the closest `SKILL.md` hub.
