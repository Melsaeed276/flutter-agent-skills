# flutter-skill-cloud

A portable knowledge base of **small, structured Markdown “skills”** for Flutter/Dart development.

- Start here: [SKILL_INDEX.md](./SKILL_INDEX.md)
- Global conventions: [META.md](./META.md)

## What this repo is for

- Mental models, patterns, examples, pitfalls, and tests/checks for Flutter + Dart.
- Consistent docs that work in any editor or AI agent workflow.
- Strong coverage of **responsive UI across screen sizes and foldable devices**.

## What this repo is not

- No secrets (tokens, endpoints, internal URLs).
- No tool-specific UI instructions.
- No copy/paste “magic commands” that depend on a particular agent runtime.

## How to contribute

1. Skim [META.md](./META.md) for style and naming rules.
2. Use [templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md](./templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md) (or [templates/CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md](./templates/CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md)).
3. Keep files small and link related topics instead of growing a single document.
4. Add a link to the new file in the nearest `SKILL.md` hub and (if it’s a major entry point) [SKILL_INDEX.md](./SKILL_INDEX.md).
