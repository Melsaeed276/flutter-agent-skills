# Widget Tests

## What to test

- Rendering given state.
- User interactions and navigation outcomes.
- Responsive decisions at multiple sizes.

## Patterns

- Provide fake dependencies (repositories/state) to keep tests deterministic.
- Prefer a small number of focused widget tests over one huge scenario test.
