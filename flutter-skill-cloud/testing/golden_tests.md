# Golden Tests

## When to use

- Visual regressions matter (design systems, responsive layouts, critical screens).

## Patterns

- Capture goldens at multiple sizes (compact and expanded).
- Keep fonts and rendering deterministic.

## Pitfalls

- Over-updating goldens instead of investigating regressions.
