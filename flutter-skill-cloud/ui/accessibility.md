# Accessibility

## Basics

- Semantics: meaningful labels for icons and controls.
- Tap targets: ensure comfortable hit areas.
- Text scale: layout should tolerate large fonts without clipping.

## Patterns

- Provide `Semantics` labels for non-text UI.
- Ensure focus order makes sense for keyboard/assistive tech.

## Pitfalls

- Conveying state only with color.
