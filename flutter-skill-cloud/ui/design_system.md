# Design System

## Mental model

A design system is a set of tokens + components + rules that produce consistent UI.

## Patterns

- Establish tokens first (color, typography, spacing).
- Wrap components as “app widgets” that encode defaults and semantics.

## Pitfalls

- Building many one-off widgets instead of reusable components.
