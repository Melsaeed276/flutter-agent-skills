# Theming Tokens

## Goal

Use semantic tokens so UI communicates meaning (“primary action”, “error”) rather than raw colors.

## Patterns

- Define a small set of semantic colors and spacing scales.
- Map tokens to `ThemeData` / `ColorScheme`.

## Pitfalls

- Component-specific colors that drift over time.
