# UI Skills

## What this domain covers

Flutter UI building blocks: Material 3, Cupertino, responsiveness, breakpoints, adaptive layouts, foldables, orientation, animations, accessibility, and design systems.

## When to read it

- Your screens must work across phones, tablets, desktop, and web.
- You’re building a design system or adopting Material 3.
- You need foldable support (hinges, postures, two-pane UI).

## Subtopics

- Responsive foundations: [responsive.md](./responsive.md)
- Breakpoints strategy: [breakpoints.md](./breakpoints.md)
- Adaptive layouts: [adaptive_layouts.md](./adaptive_layouts.md)
- Foldables UI: [foldables.md](./foldables.md)
- Orientation handling: [orientation.md](./orientation.md)
- Material 3: [material3.md](./material3.md)
- Cupertino: [cupertino.md](./cupertino.md)
- Animations: [animations.md](./animations.md)
- Accessibility: [accessibility.md](./accessibility.md)
- Design systems: [design_system.md](./design_system.md)
- Theming tokens: [theming_tokens.md](./theming_tokens.md)

## Decision guide

- If you need **one codebase across sizes**, go to [responsive.md](./responsive.md).
- If you need **a consistent sizing strategy**, go to [breakpoints.md](./breakpoints.md).
- If you need **navigation rail vs bottom nav vs master-detail**, go to [adaptive_layouts.md](./adaptive_layouts.md).
- If you need **foldable posture and two-pane layouts**, go to [foldables.md](./foldables.md) (and [../platform/foldables.md](../platform/foldables.md)).
