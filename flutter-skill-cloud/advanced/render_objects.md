# Render Objects

## When to consider

- A custom layout/paint behavior can’t be achieved efficiently with widgets alone.

## Patterns

- Start with widgets; graduate to render objects only when needed.
- Keep render object logic small and well tested.

## Pitfalls

- Debugging complexity and maintenance cost.
