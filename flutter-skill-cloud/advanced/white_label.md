# White Label

## Mental model

White-label apps share core behavior but differ in branding, feature flags, and sometimes content models.

## Patterns

- Centralize branding tokens (colors, typography, assets).
- Use configuration-driven feature flags at the composition root.

## Pitfalls

- Branching logic spread across the app instead of a configuration boundary.
